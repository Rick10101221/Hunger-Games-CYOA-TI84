# hung-game-ti84
Hunger Games on the Ti-84 Plus calculator. A game I made a few years back on my Ti-84 Plus. The game still has a few bugs since I haven't edited any of the code on a computer. Created solely on the Ti-84 in spite of its terrible syntax (yes, this is a valid boast because it was difficult, but fun).

# backstory
In high school, I'm not going to lie, AP Bio was extremely boring. In the beginning of the second semester of my sophomore year, I decided to make this CYOA game and the first thing that came to mind was The Hunger Games. Prior to this mid-life crisis, I figured out how to import text-based games from my laptop to my calculator. One that really stuck out to me was a Skyrim RPG and the coolest thing was that it came with images too. In hindsight, I wish I developed both, but I instead focused on The Hunger Games.

# update and reflection
Yeah so it's 2020 and I decided to create READMEs for all of my repos for extra repo descriptions, initial motiviation, backstories, etc. Now that I think about it, this is totally text-based and I should've thought of the possibility of developing my Hunger Games CYOA on a computer first and then uploading it to my calculator. Who would've thought?
